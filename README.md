## `Readme for repository "tests"`
This repository is built upload a test in a extra-curricular computer science course. Both "climbing_stairs.c" and "4digitnumbers.c" are programmed in C.

"climbing_stairs" is used to solve the following problem: 

>A student is climbing up n steps of stairs. The student can climb up either 1 step or 2 steps each time. Find the ways that the student can climb up to the top.

"4digit number.c" is used to find all the 4-digit-numbers that equals to the sum of their digits to their power of 4. For example, 1634=1<sup>4</sup>+6<sup>4</sup>+3<sup>4</sup>+4<sup>4</sup>.
